# Sales-Database
I have imported the sales data from kaggle in which data there are 24 field (columns) and 9994 record (row)
After that KPI has been boiled there you can analyze the data and how to create the pivot table, slicer,chart
At last I created a dashboard that gives you to information about the sales.
